          Hello, and welcome again to my website. My name is Dilshan and I'm an avid hobbyist! My hobbies include game development, building nature and physics simulators and quite recently learning how to develop both front-end and back-end utilities for webpages. You may notice that most of these are all coding related, and that's because I find programming to be a rewarding practice which can provide results instantly while being an excellent creative outlet as well. There's an odd satisfaction to studying new programming languages and APIs, and then being to use them in a reasonable way. The chase for discovering and embracing the unknown isn't merely a sisyphean labor, it's much more romantic than that. Even more so when you get the opportunity to share your creation and knowledge with others around you. Being able to inspire someone is an incredible gift and should rightfully be valued.

          One of my favourite game systems and my first to ever program was Nintendo's Game Boy Advance. I've written tons of open source projects which run magnificently on the GBA, including a psuedo physics engine for a SSB combat system. In fact, my first ever commision work was for programming a looting system for someone's idie project. Since then I've had the opportunity to work on many projects with many different people. Some open source, some confidential, yet all of them extremely enjoyable. Because of my wide range of project involvement, I've come to use many different programming and scripting languages including: ARM/THUMB ASM, C, Java, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS and many open source libraries and APIs which go with them. I'm proud to have authored many tutorials on programming for game development and have run workshops for teaching people low level programming languages for games. These days, I've taken interest to HTML5 games through Javascript. I believe a large portion of the game industry will be on portable devices, and the cross platform JS/HTML games will probably dominate that market. Hopefully that was introduction enough to give you an idea of what I plan to include on this website. Stay tuned, and maybe you'll find something that interests you!

      I've been considering whether or not a side navigation bar containing particular updates would yeild or a better browsing experience. I concluded that the website would be better designed if I maintained a "New updates" section in addition to the standard archives. I want to keep the design of the website on the minimalistic side of things, and allow the rich content and topics of interest to be the driving factors of visitor engagement. Overall, I hope that'll tackle both the aforementioned predicament as well as the overall organization.
