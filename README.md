#My website

This is a website I've decided to maintain containing overviews on various projects I'm working on as well as some insight on certain things I've learnt. Of course, the end goal of this website was for me to explore website writing from scratch (although considering I've used a bunch of neat packages, it's not exactly scratch, but close enough). I hope to refine my skills here and learn more on web development. You can visit the WIP site at: https://eternalcode.github.io/my-website/

I will modify it to a customized URL, fix the issue where I've had to include my entire bower_components folder soon. My priority is to have all the promised pages completed and then look into refining everything!
